5.1
wrote a function called calcLength that is essentially just strlen,
increments an index until the end of the string, returns the index
called it in a print statement


5.2
made a forloop that adds 1 to each number in the array, made a variable called saved to store the value that has to wrap around.
made another forloop to repeat that forloop as many times as the number entered

put all that in an if statement, made the opposite, and put it in an else statement, for the positive and negative values.

5.3
detected commas in num.csv using while loop and if statement, added 1 to commas, made a numarray with size commas
trying to figure out how to concatenate and get to the atoi part...
