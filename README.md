5.1
wrote a function called calcLength that is essentially just strlen,
increments an index until the end of the string, returns the index
called it in a print statement


5.2
made a forloop that adds 1 to each number in the array, made a variable called saved to store the value that has to wrap around.
made another forloop to repeat that forloop as many times as the number entered

put all that in an if statement, made the opposite, and put it in an else statement, for the positive and negative values.

5.3
detected commas in num.csv using while loop and if statement, added 1 to commas, made a numarray with size commas
made a while loop with if else statement to add numbers to savstr char array of size 2. added these to numarray,
computed avg.

5.4
defined enum, 
created struct, created seven instances of variable type scale each corresponding to number intervals of each mode.
I am confused about what the result of this assignment is supposed to do... 
Are we starting with an ASCII value? 
Do you want us to convert this to MIDI notes? 
Should we be giving the root note in the form of a MIDI number to begin with?
